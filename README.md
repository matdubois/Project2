Extraction

We used 2 datasets from Kaggle public platform and Data World. All of our data was based on FIFA World Cup of 1998. The sources for our dataset are as follows

•	FIFIA Ranking from Kaggle. •	FIFA Countyries Audience from Data World.

Transformation

Our first steps in cleaning up the datasets involved figuring out which variables were not relevant.

Load

The last step was to transfer our final output into a Database. We created a database and respective tables to match the columns from the final Panda’s Data Frame using POSTGRESQL and then connected to the database using SQLAlchemy and loaded the result.
